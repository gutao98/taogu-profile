In this project, we present a device-free indoor tracking system for our client, a smart lighting company, to track users and visitors who do not require to carry any devices in an office and warehouse scenario. The system constructs a mesh network using Bluetooth beacons, and we develop a real-time proximity detection algorithm which is fully embedded in beacon without the need of a central server.
