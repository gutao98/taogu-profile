In this project, we present an indoor localization system using magnetometer on smartphone. The system does not require any infrastructure or proprietary devices. We develop an augmented particle filter with a dynamic step length estimation algorithm and a heuristic particle re-sampling algorithm, and create several innovations to minimize errors and improve robustness. The prototype system achieves an accuracy of 1-2.8m on average.

This work has been reported in **UbiComp 2014, and IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing**.
