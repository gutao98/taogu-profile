This project presents a system to detect human respiration using Wi-Fi devices. The system does not require subject to wear any device, and hence detection is done in a contact-free manner. We investigate the Fresnel model for WiFi radio propagation in indoor environment and develop the theory to relate oneâ€™s breathing depth, location, and orientation to respiration. We develop a prototype system and conduct real-world experiments to evaluate the system.
