This project aims to investigate the fundamental problem of recognizing activities of multiple users using wearable sensors in a home environment. We design a multimodal system to capture observations for multiple users and propose a novel pattern mining approach to recognize multi-user activities. This is the first reported work on multi-user activity recognition using wearable sensors.

This work has been reported in **MobiQuitous 2009, and IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing**.
