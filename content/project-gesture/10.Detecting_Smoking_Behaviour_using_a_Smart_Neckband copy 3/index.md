This project proposes the design of a smart neckband device for smoking detection. The device is equipped with acoustic sensors to detect smoking sessions and puffs. We propose a framework in which the lower-layer detects the sub-movements, i.e., lighter usage, hand-to-mouth gesture and deep breathing; and the higher-layer detects smoking puffs and sessions. Real-world experiments suggest our system can accurately detect smoking puffs and sessions with F1 score of respectively 93.59% and 92.96%.
