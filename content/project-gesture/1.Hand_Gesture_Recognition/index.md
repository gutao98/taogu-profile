This project presents an in-air writing gesture recognition system using a wrist-worn device. We propose a novel contour-based gesture model which converts human gestures to contours in 3D space, and then recognize the contours as characters. We introduce Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to detect the principal/writing plane in 3D space, and then tune the projected 2D contour in the principal plane through reversing, rotating and normalizing operations.
