Significant growth in the aging population presents many challenges, which calls an urgent need to develop innovative technologies that help the elderly live independently and safely in their own homes. In this work, we propose a system using low-cost RFID tags, which enables device-free, unobtrusive monitoring of elderly people by leveraging machine learning algorithms and the Internet of Things (IoT) technology. We propose several machine learning algorithms to enable device-free localization and activity recognition by learning RSSI of RFID tags.
