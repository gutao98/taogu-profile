This project presents the design of an audio-based highly-accurate system for human respiration monitoring, leveraging on commodity speaker and microphone widely available in home environments. The basic idea behind the audio-based method is that when a user is close to a pair of speaker and microphone, body movement during respiration causes periodic audio signal changes, which can be extracted to obtain the respiration rate. Experimental results show that our system detects respiration with the median error lower than 0.35 breaths/min, outperforming the state-of-the-art.
