Personal mobile sensing is fast permeating our daily lives to enable activity monitoring, healthcare and rehabilitation. Towards pushing deep learning on devices, we present MDLdroid, our first version of a novel decentralized mobile deep learning framework to enable resource-aware on-device collaborative learning for personal mobile sensing applications. The framework leverages on multiple mobile devices connected via a mesh network to realize complete training and interference on devices. Our evaluations show that our model training on off-the-shelf mobile devices achieves 2x to 3.5x faster than single-device training, and 1.5x faster than the master-slave approach.
