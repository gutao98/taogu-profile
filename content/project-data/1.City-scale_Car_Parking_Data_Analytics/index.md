The on-street parking system is an indispensable part of civic projects, as it provides travellers and shoppers with parking spaces. In this project, we use a large real-world dataset with on-street parking sensor data from Melbourne City Council and establish a formulation of the travelling officer problem with a probability-based model. We propose two solutions using a spatio-temporal probability model for parking officers to maximize the number of infringing cars caught with limited time cost. Using real-world parking sensor data and Google Maps road network information, the experimental results show that our proposed algorithms outperform the existing patrolling routes.
