In this project, we propose a novel routing metric that efficiently captures packet transmission cost in heterogeneous duty-cycled WSNs by estimating both expected rendezvous cost and communication cost. Based on this metric, we design an opportunistic routing protocol which is proved to select optimal routes with the least packet transmission cost.
