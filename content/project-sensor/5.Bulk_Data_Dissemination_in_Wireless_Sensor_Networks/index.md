Data dissemination is a fundamental service offered by low-power wireless networks. This project proposes a novel sender impact metric which jointly exploits link quality and spatial link diversity to calculate the gain/cost ratio of the sender candidates. We develop a generic sender selection scheme based on the metric that can generally support both types of dissemination using native packets and network coding.
