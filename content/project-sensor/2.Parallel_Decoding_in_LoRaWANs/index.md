This project presents a novel communication paradigm that enables parallel demodulation of colliding LoRa transmissions. We resolve LoRa collisions at the physical layer and thereby support parallel decoding for LoRa transmissions. We propose a novel technique to separate collided transmissions by jointly considering both the time domain and the frequency domain features.
