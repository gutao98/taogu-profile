In this work, we design a simple yet effective error recovery code that uses XOR code to minimize delay and uses RSSI-hinted approach to detect in-packet corruptions without CRC. We take a different view from traditional approaches that burstiness may be helpful. With burstiness, the requirement is reduced as “recovering any k consecutive errors”.  

The work appears in <strong> IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing (TMC) in 2017</strong>.
